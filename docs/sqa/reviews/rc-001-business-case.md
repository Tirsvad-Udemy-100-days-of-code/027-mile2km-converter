| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | No `*.en.md` or other translated twin exists. |

| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | S01, a competent English reader and the Product Owner for the IT domain, accepted the plan documents in chat on 2026-10-13. |
